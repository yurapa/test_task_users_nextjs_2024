Task Description:

Project Overview: Develop a web application using React or Next.js that integrates with the free API provided by Reqres (https://reqres.in/). The project must include the implementation of various pages and functionality as described below.

Task Requirements:

Pages to Create:
* Login Page
* Sign Up Page
* User List Page
* Single User Page


Page Logic and API Integration:
* Implement the necessary logic on each page to interact with the Reqres API.
* Ensure the functionality aligns with the API's capabilities and endpoints.
* CRUD Operations:
* Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for user data using the Reqres API.

Technical Requirements:

Framework:
Use either React or Next.js to build the project.
TypeScript:
Define a basic structure using TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.
Styling:
Styles are not required for browser visuals but should be defined for future updates.
Form Validation:
Set up validation for form inputs to ensure data integrity and user input correctness.
Request Management:
Choose any request management solution that fits the project's needs (e.g., Axios, Fetch API).
Architecture:
Decide between Single Page Application (SPA) or Server-Side Rendering (SSR) based on the project requirements.
Project Structure:
Ensure the project structure is clear and organized for ease of maintenance and scalability.



Expected Outcomes:

The project should run seamlessly in both development and production environments.
The following pages should be functional and integrated with the Reqres API:
Login
Sign Up
User List (protected route)
Single User (protected route)
Authentication should be implemented to protect the User List and Single User pages.
CRUD operations for users should be fully functional.
